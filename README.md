#### Interactive Photo Gallery & Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solution to the Interactive Photo Gallery and the two coding challenges as part of the coding assessment.

### Interactive Photo Gallery

The interactive photo gallery is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, matching the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/photo-gallery.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the interactive photo gallery.

#### Features:

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.
- Hover interaction to display additional details when hovering over a photo.
- Cross-browser compatibility ensured for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Coding Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Array Manipulation (arrayMap.js)

The goal of this challenge is to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the given array that sums up to the target.

#### Challenge 2: String Transformation (stringTransform.js)

In this challenge, the string is transformed based on certain rules depending on its length.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Run the JavaScript files using Node.js:
    ```
    node arrayMap.js
    node stringTransform.js
    ```

#### Solutions:

- **Challenge 1:** The `hasContiguousSubarray` function in `arrayMap.js` returns `true` if a contiguous subarray with the target sum exists, otherwise `false`.
  
- **Challenge 2:** The `transformString` function in `stringTransform.js` applies transformations to the given string based on its length.

### Repository Structure:

- **index.html**: HTML file for the interactive photo gallery.
- **styles.css**: CSS file for styling the gallery.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file for gallery functionality.
- **arrayMap.js**: JavaScript file for the solution to Challenge 1.
- **stringTransform.js**: JavaScript file for the solution to Challenge 2.
