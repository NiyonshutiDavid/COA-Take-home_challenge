This HTML file is the main entry point for the Interactive Photo Gallery.
It includes the necessary CSS styles and JavaScript code to dynamically create the gallery.

The gallery items are inserted into the DOM using JavaScript, based on an array of images with their source, title, and location.
When a gallery item is clicked, a modal will open with the full-size image, its title, and location.
The gallery items will have an overlay that shows the title and location when the cursor hovers over them.
The gallery items will animate smoothly when the cursor hovers over them, and they will react to touch input on mobile devices.
